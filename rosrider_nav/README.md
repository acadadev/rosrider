# üß≠ ROS2 Navigation Commands and Workflow

This guide outlines the common ROS 2 launch commands for essential navigation tasks, including Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), localization with a known map, and configuring keepout filters.

### üéØ Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

SLAM is used to **create a map** of an environment while simultaneously tracking the robot's position within that map. Use this when the environment is unknown.

| Task       | Environment | Command                                                                    |
|:-----------|:------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SLAM       | Real Robot  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_slam2.launch.py use_sim_time:=False``` |
| Navigation | Real Robot  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_nav2.launch.py use_sim_time:=False```  |

### üó∫Ô∏è Saving Maps

After navigating the robot, use the following command to save the map and generate the required ```map_name.yaml``` and ```map_name.pgm``` files.

```commandline
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f map_name
```

Move the files to the `rosrider_nav/map` folder.
This allows you to use the `map:=map_file_path` argument when running localization with your own maps. 

### üìç Localization

| Task         | Environment | Command                                                                           |
|:-------------|:------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Localization | Real Robot  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_localization.launch.py use_sim_time:=False``` |
| Navigation   | Real Robot  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_nav2.launch.py use_sim_time:=False```         |

### üö´ Keepout Filters

Keepout filters define areas on the map that the robot must avoid (e.g., stairs, sensitive equipment). **Localization** must be active before you can use the keepout filters.

| Task           | Environment | Command                                                                      |
|:---------------|:------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keepout Filter | Real Robot  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_keepout.launch.py use_sim_time:=False``` |

**Note:** The **nav_params.yaml** file must be configured to support keepout filter functionality.

```commandline
local_costmap:
  local_costmap:
    ros__parameters:
      ...	
      plugins: ["voxel_layer", "inflation_layer"]
      ...
      filters: ["keepout_filter"]
      keepout_filter:
        plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::KeepoutFilter"
        enabled: False
        filter_info_topic: "/costmap_filter_info"
      ...
global_costmap:
  global_costmap:
    ros__parameters:
      ...
      plugins: ["static_layer", "obstacle_layer", "inflation_layer"]
      ...
      filters: ["keepout_filter"]
      ...
      keepout_filter:
        plugin: "nav2_costmap_2d::KeepoutFilter"
        enabled: False
        filter_info_topic: "/costmap_filter_info"

```

### üëÅÔ∏è Visualization

Use RViz to visualize the robot, sensor data, map, and navigation planning outputs.

```commandline
ros2 launch nav2_bringup rviz_launch.py
```

### üéÆ Use with Gazebo Simulator

To run navigation tasks in the Gazebo simulation environment, you must first launch the simulator and then execute the SLAM or Localization commands with the use_sim_time argument set to True.

#### Launch Gazebo Simulator

```commandline
ros2 launch rosrider_gz_bringup world_willow.launch.py launch_rviz:=False
```

#### Execute Navigation in Simulation: 

Append ```use_sim_time:=True``` to the relevant command from sections on SLAM and Localization

**For SLAM**

| Task       | Environment | Command                                                                   |
|:-----------|:------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SLAM       | Simulation  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_slam2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True``` |
| Navigation | Simulation  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_nav2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True```  |

**For Localization**

| Task         | Environment | Command                                                                          |
|:-------------|:------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Localization | Simulation  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_localization.launch.py use_sim_time:=True``` |
| Navigation   | Simulation  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_nav2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True```         |

**For Keepout Filters**

| Task           | Environment | Command                                                                     |
|:---------------|:------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keepout Filter | Simulation  | ```ros2 launch rosrider_nav bringup_keepout.launch.py use_sim_time:=True``` |

### üí° Supplementary Visualization and Context

The **global costmap** provides a high-level, static view of the entire environment to plan long-distance paths, while the **local costmap** is smaller, dynamic, 
and continuously updated with new sensor data for immediate obstacle avoidance and finer path adjustments.

The robot's primary navigation functions, including the **global planner** for long-range pathfinding and the **local controller** for immediate obstacle avoidance, rely heavily on the distinct information provided by these two costmaps.

![RVIZ Navigation Local Map](https://docs.acada.dev/rosrider_doc/images/rosrider/nav_local_global_map.png)

*Fig 3. RVIZ interface visualizing robot data while navigating*

The RVIZ screen provides a crucial visualization of the robot's localization within the known map and allows the user to command the robot by sending goal points via
the **2D Goal Pose** tool. Once a goal is established, the Nav2 stack processes the costmap data to generate a safe global path and dynamically manages the local plan
in real-time, ensuring the robot avoids both known static features and newly detected moving obstacles along the way.
